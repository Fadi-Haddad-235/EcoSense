> EcoSense is a mobile app for real-time monitoring of indoor air quality, providing users with essential information about their environment. With EcoSense, users can easily track air vitals such as air quality, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, temperature, and humidity. By providing up-to-date information, EcoSense empowers users to make informed decisions about their health and the environment around them.

### User Stories
-As a user, I want to be able to log into the app with my credentials, so that I can access my indoor air quality data and settings
-As a user, I want to be able to check the real-time readings of air quality, Carbon Monoxide, Carbon Dioxide, temperature, and humidity in my room, so that I can monitor the indoor air quality
-As a user, I want to receive real-time updates/notifications on air quality, Carbon Monoxide, Carbon Dioxide, temperature, and humidity levels in my room, so that I can take necessary actions if needed.
-As a user, I want to be able to view historical data on the air quality in my room, so that I can track changes over time
and make informed decisions.
-As a user, I want to be able to set up alerts for specific thresholds for air quality, Carbon Monoxide, Carbon Dioxide, temperature, and humidity, so that I can take action before the air quality gets too bad.
-As a user, I want to be able to turn on/off the heater or the fan manually.
-As a user, I want to be able to turn the indoor air quality monitor on or off remotely from my phone, so that I can easily manage its operation
-As a user, I want the app to have a night mode option that I can toggle on or off depending on the ambient light conditions

<!-- Tech stack -->
<img src="./readme/title5.svg"/>

###  Coffee Express is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Hive](https://hivedb.dev/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- To send local push notifications, the app uses the [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) package which supports Android, iOS, and macOS.
  - ðŸš¨ Currently, notifications aren't working on macOS. This is a known issue that we are working to resolve!
- The app uses the font ["Work Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
